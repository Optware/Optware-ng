+	For it had been long apparent to Count Landulf that nothing
+	could be done with his seventh son Thomas, except to make him
+	an Abbot or something of that kind.  Born in 1226, he had from
+	childhood a mysterious objection to becoming a predatory eagle,
+	or even to taking an ordinary interest in falconry or tilting
+	or any other gentlemanly pursuits.  He was a large and heavy and
+	quiet boy, and phenomenally silent, scarcely opening his mouth
+	except to say suddenly to his schoolmaster in an explosive
+	manner, "What is God?"  The answer is not recorded but it is
+	probable that the asker went on worrying out answers for himself.
+		[ The Runaway Abbot, by G. K. Chesterton ]
+	A short studded or spiked club attached to a cord allowing
+	it to be drawn back to the wielder after having been thrown.
+	It should not be confused with the atlatl, which is a device
+	used to throw spears for longer distances.
+	Said to be a doppelganger sent to inflict divine punishment
+	for alignment violations.
+	Altars are of three types:
+	1.  In Temples.  These are for Sacrifices [...].  The stone
+	top will have grooves for blood, and the whole will be covered
+	with _dry brown stains of a troubling kind_ from former
+	Sacrifices.
+	[ The Tough Guide to Fantasyland, by Diana Wynne Jones ]
+
+	To every man upon this earth
+	Death cometh soon or late;
+	And how can man die better
+	Than facing fearful odds
+	For the ashes of his fathers
+	And the temples of his gods?
+		[ Lays of Ancient Rome, by Thomas B. Macaulay ]
+	The Shinto sun goddess, Amaterasu Omikami is the central
+	figure of Shintoism and the ancestral deity of the imperial
+	house.  One of the daughters of the primordial god Izanagi
+	and said to be his favourite offspring, she was born from
+	his left eye.
+		[ Encyclopedia of Gods, by Michael Jordan ]
+	"Tree sap," Wu explained, "often flows over insects and traps
+	them.  The insects are then perfectly preserved within the
+	fossil.  One finds all kinds of insects in amber - including
+	biting insects that have sucked blood from larger animals."
+		[ Jurassic Park, by Michael Crichton ]
+	Get thee hence, nor come again,
+	Mix not memory with doubt,
+	Pass, thou deathlike type of pain,
+	Pass and cease to move about!
+	'Tis the blot upon the brain
+	That will show itself without.
+		...
+	For, Maud, so tender and true,
+	As long as my life endures
+	I feel I shall owe you a debt,
+	That I never can hope to pay;
+	And if ever I should forget
+	That I owe this debt to you
+	And for your sweet sake to yours;
+	O then, what then shall I say? -
+	If ever I should forget,
+	May God make me more wretched
+	Than ever I have been yet!

+	Once in a great while, when the positions of the stars are

+	along will come a snake, to coil around the egg, or a toad,
+	to squat upon the egg, keeping it warm and helping it to
+	hatch.  When it hatches, out comes a creature called basilisk,
+	or cockatrice, the most deadly of all creatures.  A single
+	glance from its yellow, piercing toad's eyes will kill both
+	man and beast.  Its power of destruction is said to be so
+	great that sometimes simply to hear its hiss can prove fatal.
+	Its breath is so venomous that it causes all vegetation

+
+	There is, however, one creature which can withstand the

+	the weasel knows the basilisk's fatal weakness:  if it ever
+	sees its own reflection in a mirror it will perish instantly.

+	Fungi, division of simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true
+	stems, roots, and leaves.  Unlike algae, fungi cannot
+	photosynthesize, and live as parasites or saprophytes.  The
+	division comprises the slime molds and true fungi.  True
+	fungi are multicellular (with the exception of yeasts); the
+	body of most true fungi consists of slender cottony
+	filaments, or hyphae.  All fungi are capable of asexual
+	reproduction by cell division, budding, fragmentation, or
+	spores.  Those that reproduce sexually alternate a sexual
+	generation (gametophyte) with a spore-producing one.  The
+	four classes of true fungi are the algaelike fungi (e.g.,
+	black bread mold and downy mildew), sac fungi (e.g., yeasts,
+	powdery mildews, truffles, and blue and green molds such as
+	Penicillium), basidium fungi (e.g., mushrooms and puffballs)
+	and imperfect fungi (e.g., species that cause athlete's foot
+	and ringworm).  Fungi help decompose organic matter (important
+	in soil renewal); are valuable as a source of antibiotics,

+	let him in with honour.
+
+	At the dinner, I-Hsiu sat in front of the table full of

+	his sleeves.  The general was curious, and whispered to
+	him, "This is very embarrassing.  Do you want to take
+	some food back to the temple?  I will order the cook to
+	prepare some take out orders for you."  "No" replied the

+	keep me right there."
+		[ Unicorn Variations, by Roger Zelazny ]
+	The Valkyries were the thirteen choosers of the slain, the
+	beautiful warrior-maids of Odin who rode through the air and
+	over the sea.  They watched the progress of the battle and
+	selected the heroes who were to fall fighting.  After they
+	were dead, the maidens rewarded the heroes by kissing them
+	and then led their souls to Valhalla, where the warriors
+	lived happily in an ideal existence, drinking and eating
+	without restraint and fighting over again the battles in
+	which they died and in which they had won their deathless
+	fame.
+		[ The Encyclopaedia of Myths and Legends of All
+			Nations, by Herbert Robinson and Knox
+			Wilson ]
+	The Oxford English Dictionary is quite unequivocal:
+	_vampire_ - "a preternatural being of a malignant nature (in
+	the original and usual form of the belief, a reanimated
+	corpse), supposed to seek nourishment, or do harm, by sucking
+	the blood of sleeping persons. ..."
+	Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, was the daughter of
+	Jupiter and Dione.  Others say that Venus sprang from the
+	foam of the sea.  The zephyr wafted her along the waves to
+	the Isle of Cyprus, where she was received and attired by
+	the Seasons, and then led to the assembly of the gods.  All
+	were charmed with her beauty, and each one demanded her
+	for his wife.  Jupiter gave her to Vulcan, in gratitude for
+	the service he had rendered in forging thunderbolts.  So
+	the most beautiful of the goddesses became the wife of the
+	most ill-favoured of gods.
+		[ Bulfinch's Mythology, by Thomas Bulfinch ]
+	Vlad Dracula the Impaler was a 15th-Century monarch of the
+	Birgau region of the Carpathian Mountains, in what is now
+	Romania.  In Romanian history he is best known for two things.
+	One was his skilled handling of the Ottoman Turks, which kept
+	them from making further inroads into Christian Europe.  The
+	other was the ruthless manner in which he ran his fiefdom.
+	He dealt with perceived challengers to his rule by impaling
+	them upright on wooden stakes.  Visiting dignitaries who
+	failed to doff their hats had them nailed to their head.
+	Swirling clouds of pure elemental energies, the vortices are
+	thought to be related to the larger elementals.  Though the
+	vortices do no damage when touched, they are noted for being
+	able to envelop unwary travellers.  The hapless fool thus
+	swallowed by a vortex will soon perish from exposure to the
+	element the vortex is composed of.
+	The vrock is one of the weaker forms of demon.  It resembles
+	a cross between a human being and a vulture and does physical
+	damage by biting and by using the claws on both its arms and
+	feet.
+	The samurai warrior traditionally wears two swords; the
+	wakizashi is the shorter of the two.  See also katana.
+	'Saruman!' he cried, and his voice grew in power and authority.
+	'Behold, I am not Gandalf the Grey, whom you betrayed.  I am
+	Gandalf the White, who has returned from death.  You have no
+	colour now, and I cast you from the order and from the Council.'
+	He raised his hand, and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice.
+	'Saruman, your staff is broken.'  There was a crack, and the
+	staff split asunder in Saruman's hand, and the head of it
+	fell down at Gandalf's feet.  'Go!' said Gandalf.  With a cry
+	Saruman fell back and crawled away.
+		[ The Two Towers, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
+	Suddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet.  "How the wind howls!"
+	he cried.  "It is howling with wolf-voices.  The Wargs have
+	come west of the Mountains!"
+	"Need we wait until morning then?" said Gandalf.  "It is as I
+	said.  The hunt is up!  Even if we live to see the dawn, who
+	now will wish to journey south by night with the wild wolves
+	on his trail?"
+	"How far is Moria?" asked Boromir.
+	"There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles
+	as the crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,"
+	answered Gandalf grimly.
+	"Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if we can,"
+	said Boromir.  "The wolf that one hears is worse than the orc
+	that one fears."
+	"True!" said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath.  "But
+	where the warg howls, there also the orc prowls."
+		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
+	They had come together at the ford of the Trident while the
+	battle crashed around them, Robert with his warhammer and his
+	great antlered helm, the Targaryen prince armored all in
+	black.  On his breastplate was the three-headed dragon of his
+	House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the
+	sunlight.  The waters of the Trident ran red around the
+	hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed, again
+	and again, until at last a crushing blow from Robert's hammer
+	stove in the dragon and the chest behind it.  When Ned had
+	finally come on the scene, Rhaegar lay dead in the stream,
+	while men of both armies scrambled in the swirling waters for
+	rubies knocked free of his armor.
+		[ A Game of Thrones, by George R.R. Martin ]
+	Day after day, day after day,
+	We stuck, nor breath nor motion;
+	As idle as a painted ship
+	Upon a painted ocean.
+
+	Water, water, everywhere,
+	And all the boards did shrink;
+	Water, water, everywhere
+	Nor any drop to drink.
+		[ The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, by Samuel Taylor
+		  Coleridge ]
+	Oh what a tangled web we weave,
+	When first we practise to deceive!
+		[ Marmion, by Sir Walter Scott ]
+	When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall
+	nothing except a sense of dread.  Then suddenly he knew that
+	he was imprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow.  A
+	Barrow-wight had taken him, and he was probably already under
+	the dreadful spells of the Barrow-wights about which whispered
+	tales spoke.  He dared not move, but lay as he found himself:
+	flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his
+	breast.
+		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
+	Ebenezum walked before me along the closest thing we could
+	find to a path in these overgrown woods.  Every few paces he
+	would pause, so that I, burdened with a pack stuffed with
+	arcane and heavy paraphernalia, could catch up with his
+	wizardly strides.  He, as usual, carried nothing, preferring,
+	as he often said, to keep his hands free for quick conjuring
+	and his mind free for the thoughts of a mage.
+		[ A Dealing with Demons, by Craig Shaw Gardner ]
+	No one knows how old this mighty wizard is, or from whence he
+	came.  It is known that, having lived a span far greater than
+	any normal man's, he grew weary of lesser mortals; and so,
+	spurning all human company, he forsook the dwellings of men
+	and went to live in the depths of the Earth.  He took with
+	him a dreadful artifact, the Book of the Dead, which is said
+	to hold great power indeed.  Many have sought to find the
+	wizard and his treasure, but none have found him and lived to
+	tell the tale.  Woe be to the incautious adventurer who
+	disturbs this mighty sorcerer!
+	The ancestors of the modern day domestic dog, wolves are
+	powerful muscular animals with bushy tails.  Intelligent,
+	social animals, wolves live in family groups or packs made
+	up of multiple family units.  These packs cooperate in hunting
+	down prey.
+	The Usenet Oracle requires an answer to this question!
+
+	> How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could
+	> chuck wood?
+
+	"Oh, heck!  I'll handle *this* one!"  The Oracle spun the terminal
+	back toward himself, unlocked the ZOT-guard lock, and slid the
+	glass guard away from the ZOT key.  "Ummmm....could you turn around
+	for a minute?  ZOTs are too graphic for the uninitiated.  Even *I*
+	get a little squeamish sometimes..."  The neophyte turned around,
+	and heard the Oracle slam his finger on a computer key, followed
+	by a loud ZZZZOTTTTT and the smell of ozone.
+		[ Excerpted from Internet Oracularity 576.6 ]
+	[The crysknife] is manufactured in two forms from teeth taken
+	from dead sandworms.  The two forms are "fixed" and "unfixed".
+	An unfixed knife requires proximity to a human body's
+	electrical field to prevent disintegration.  Fixed knives
+	are treated for storage.  All are about 20 centimeters long.
+		[ Dune, by Frank Herbert ]
+	Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim
+	and dark, the shapes became terribly clear.  He was able to
+	see beneath their black wrappings.  There were five tall
+	figures:  two standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing.
+	In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; under
+	their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs
+	were helms of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of
+	steel.  Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they
+	rushed towards him.  Desperate, he drew his own sword, and
+	it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a
+	firebrand.  Two of the figures halted.  The third was taller
+	than the others:  his hair was long and gleaming and on his
+	helm was a crown.  In one hand he held a long sword, and in
+	the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it
+	glowed with a pale light.  He sprang forward and bore down
+	on Frodo.
+		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
+	The Wumpus, by the way, is not bothered by the hazards since
+	he has sucker feet and is too big for a bat to lift.  If you
+	try to shoot him and miss, there's also a chance that he'll
+	up and move himself into another cave, though by nature the
+	Wumpus is a sedentary creature.
+		[ wump (6) -- "Hunt the Wumpus" ]
+	They sent their friend the mosquito [xan] ahead of them to
+	find out what lay ahead.  "Since you are the one who sucks
+	the blood of men walking along paths," they told the mosquito,
+	"go and sting the men of Xibalba."  The mosquito flew
+	down the dark road to the Underworld.  Entering the house of
+	the Lords of Death, he stung the first person that he saw...
+
+	The mosquito stung this man as well, and when he yelled, the
+	man next to him asked, "Gathered Blood, what's wrong?"  So
+	he flew along the row stinging all the seated men until he
+	knew the names of all twelve.
+			[ Popul Vuh, as translated by Ralph Nelson ]
+	A distant cousin of the earth elemental, the xorn has the
+	ability to shift the cells of its body around in such a way
+	that it becomes porous to inert material.  This gives it the
+	ability to pass through any obstacle that might be between it
+	and its next meal.
+	The arrow of choice of the samurai, ya are made of very
+	straight bamboo, and are tipped with hardened steel.
+	Yeenoghu, the demon lord of gnolls, still exists although
+	all his followers have been wiped off the face of the earth.
+	He casts magic projectiles at those close to him, and a mere
+	gaze into his piercing eyes may hopelessly confuse the
+	battle-weary adventurer.
+	The Abominable Snowman, or yeti, is one of the truly great
+	unknown animals of the twentieth century.  It is a large hairy
+	biped that lives in the Himalayan region of Asia ... The story
+	of the Abominable Snowman is filled with mysteries great and
+	small, and one of the most difficult of all is how it got that
+	awful name.  The creature is neither particularly abominable,
+	nor does it necessarily live in the snows.  _Yeti_ is a Tibetan
+	word which may apply either to a real, but unknown animal of
+	the Himalayas, or to a mountain spirit or demon -- no one is
+	quite sure which.  And after nearly half a century in which
+	Westerners have trampled around looking for the yeti, and
+	asking all sorts of questions, the original native traditions
+	concerning the creature have become even more muddled and
+	confused.
+		[ The Encyclopedia of Monsters, by Daniel Cohen ]
+	Japanese leather archery gloves.  Gloves made for use while
+	practicing had thumbs reinforced with horn.  Those worn into
+	battle had thumbs reinforced with a double layer of leather.
+	The samurai is highly trained with a special type of bow,
+	the yumi.  Like the ya, the yumi is made of bamboo.  With
+	the yumi-ya, the bow and arrow, the samurai is an extremely
+	accurate and deadly warrior.
+	The zombi... is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but
+	taken from the grave and endowed by sorcery with a
+	mechanical semblance of life, -- it is a dead body which is
+	made to walk and act and move as if it were alive.
+		[ W. B. Seabrook ]
+	The zruty are wild and gigantic beings, living in the
+	wildernesses of the Tatra mountains.
