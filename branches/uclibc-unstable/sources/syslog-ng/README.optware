syslog-ng

This is a port of syslog-ng for Optware. It can be used as a replacement
for the original syslog provided by Unslung in the NSLU2, and should also
work for the  platforms.

Disabling the built-in syslog on Unslung 6.x

Before using syslog-ng, you must disable the built-in syslog provided by
Unslung 6.x. To do that, comment the two lines on /etc/inittab that mention
syslogd and klog by adding '#' to the beginning of each line.
