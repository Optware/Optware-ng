# You can also check the website at http://mt-daapd.sourceforge.net,

# forums and possibly more.
#

#
# web_root (required)
#
# Location of the admin web pages.  If you installed from
# ipk, this is correct
#

web_root	/opt/share/mt-daapd/admin-root

#
# port (required)
#
# What port to listen on.  It is possible to use a different
# port, but this is the default iTunes port
#

port		3689

#
# admin_pw (required)
#
# This is the password to the administrative pages
# 
# YOU SHOULD PROBABLY CHANGE THIS
#

admin_pw	mt-daapd

#
# db_dir (required)
#
# This is where mt-daapd stores its database of song information.  
#
# If you installed this from .ipk, this is correct
#

db_dir		/opt/var/mt-daapd

#
# mp3_dir (required)
#
# Location of the mp3 files to share.  This corresponds
# to a folder called "mp3" in the "DISK 1" share.
#

mp3_dir		/share/hdd/data/public/mp3

#
# servername (required)
#
# This is both the name of the server as advertised
# via rendezvous, and the name of the database
# exported via DAAP
#

servername	NSLU2 Music

#
# runas (required)
#
# This is the user to drop privs to if running as
# root.  If mt-daapd is not started as root, this
# configuration option is ignored.  Notice that this
# must be specified whether the server is running
# as root or not.
#
# If you have not messed with permissions from
# the console, then this should work correctly
# without any strange chmods or anything.
#

runas	guest

#
# playlist (optional)
#
# This is the location of a playlist file.
# This is for Apple-style "Smart Playlists"
# See the mt-daapd.playlist file in the 
# contrib directory for syntax and examples
#
# This doesn't control static playlists... these
# are controlled with the "process_m3u" directive
# below.
#

playlist	/opt/etc/mt-daapd/mt-daapd.playlist

#
# password (optional)
#
# This is the password required to listen to MP3 files
# i.e. the password that iTunes prompts for
#

#password	mp3

#
# extensions (optional)
#
# These are the file extensions that the daap server will
# try to index and serve.  By default, it only indexes and
# serves .mp3 files.  It can also server .m4a and .m4p files,
# and just about any other files, really.  Unfortunately, while
# it can *attempt* to serve other files (.ogg?), iTunes won't
# play them.  Perhaps this would be useful on Linux with
# Rhythmbox, once it understands daap.  (hurry up!)
#

extensions .mp3,.m4a,.m4p


#
# logfile (optional)
#
# This is the file to log to.  If this is not configured,
# then it will log to the syslog.
#
# Not that the -d <level> switch will control the log verbosity.
# By default, it runs at log level 1.  Log level 9 will churn
# out scads of useless debugging information.  Values in between
# will vary the amount of logging you get.
#

#logfile /var/log/mt-daapd.log

#
# art_filename (optional)
#
# There is experimental support thanks to Hiren Joshi
# (hirenj@mooh.org) for dynamically adding art to the id3v2
# header as it is streamed (!!).  If you were using a music system
# like zina or andromeda, for example, with cover art called 
# "_folderOpenImage.jpg", you could use the parameter
# art_file _folderOpenImage.jpg and if the file _folderOpenImage.jpg
# was located in the same folder as the .mp3 file, it would appear
# in iTunes.  Cool, eh? 
#

#art_filename _folderOpenImage.jpg

#
# rescan_interval
#
# How often to check the file system to see if any mp3 files
# have been added or removed. 
#
# if not specified, the default is 0, which disables background scanning.
#
# If background rescanning is disabled, a scan can still be forced from the 
# "status" page of the administrative web interface
#
# Setting a rescan_interval lower than the time it takes to rescan
# won't hurt anything, it will just waste CPU, and make connect times
# to the daap server longer.
#

# We'll set it to 10 minutes
#
rescan_interval 600

# always_scan 
#
# The default behavior is not not do background rescans of the
# filesystem unless there are clients connected.  The thought is to
# allow the drives to spin down unless they are in use.  This might be
# of more importance in IDE drives that aren't designed to be run
# 24x7.  Forcing a scan through the web interface will always work
# though, even if no users are connected.

always_scan 0

# 
# process_m3u
#
# By default m3u processing is turned off, since most m3u files
# sitting around in peoples mp3 directories have bad paths, and
# I hear about it.  :)
#
# If you are sure your m3u files have good paths (i.e. unixly pathed,
# with relative paths relative to the directory the m3u is in), then
# you can turn on m3u processing by setting this directive to 1.
#
# I'm not sure "unixly" is a word, but you get the idea.
#

#process_m3u 0

#
# scan_type
# 
#
# This sets how aggressively mp3 files should be scanned to determine
# file length.  There are three values:
#
# 0 (Normal) 
#   Just scan the first mp3 frame to try and calculate size.  This will
#   be accurate for most files, but VBR files without an Xing tag will
#   probably have wildly inaccurate file times.  This is the default.
#
# 1 (Aggressive)
#   This checks the bitrates of 10 frames in the middle of the song.  
#   This will still be inaccurate for VBR files without an Xing tag,
#   but they probably won't be quite as inaccurate as 0.  This takes
#   more time, obviously, although the time hit will only happen the
#   first time you scan a particular file.
#
# 2 (Painfully aggressive)
#   This walks through the entire song, counting the number of frames.
#   This should result in accurate song times, but will take the most
#   time.  Again, this will only have to be incurred the first time
#   the file is indexed.
# 

# scan_type  0

#
# compress
#
# Whether to use gzip content-encoding when transferring playlists etc.
# This was contributed as a patch by Ciamac Moallemi just prior to the 0.2.1
# release, and as such, hasn't gotten as much testing as other features.
#
# This feature should substantially speed up transfers of large databases
# and playlists, at least where bandwidth is limited.
#
# It will eventually default to 1, but currently it defaults to 0.
#
# DONT EVEN THINK OF ENABLING THIS ON THE SLUG.  IT WILL
# DEGRADE PERFORMANCE MASSIVELY.  It might even trigger the
# OOM killer, so just pretend this option isn't here.
#
# In fact, it's only here for the sake of completeness.

# compress 0
