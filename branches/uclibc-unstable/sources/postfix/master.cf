#
# Postfix master process configuration file.  Each logical line 
# describes how a Postfix daemon program should be run. 
#
# A logical line starts with non-whitespace, non-comment text.
# Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as are comment 
# lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.  
# A line that starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
#
# The fields that make up each line are described below. A "-" field
# value requests that a default value be used for that field.
#
# Service: any name that is valid for the specified transport type
# (the next field).  With INET transports, a service is specified as
# host:port.  The host part (and colon) may be omitted. Either host
# or port may be given in symbolic form or in numeric form. Examples
# for the SMTP server:  localhost:smtp receives mail via the loopback
# interface only; 10025 receives mail on port 10025.
#
# Transport type: "inet" for Internet sockets, "unix" for UNIX-domain
# sockets, "fifo" for named pipes.
#
# Private: whether or not access is restricted to the mail system.
# Default is private service.  Internet (inet) sockets can't be private.
#
# Unprivileged: whether the service runs with root privileges or as
# the owner of the Postfix system (the owner name is controlled by the
# mail_owner configuration variable in the main.cf file). Only the
# pipe, virtual and local delivery daemons require privileges.
#
# Chroot: whether or not the service runs chrooted to the mail queue
# directory (pathname is controlled by the queue_directory configuration
# variable in the main.cf file). Presently, all Postfix daemons can run
# chrooted, except for the pipe, virtual and local delivery daemons.
# The proxymap server can run chrooted, but doing so defeats most of
# the purpose of having that service in the first place.
# The files in the examples/chroot-setup subdirectory describe how
# to set up a Postfix chroot environment for your type of machine.
#
# Wakeup time: automatically wake up the named service after the
# specified number of seconds. A ? at the end of the wakeup time
# field requests that wake up events be sent only to services that
# are actually being used.  Specify 0 for no wakeup. Presently, only
# the pickup, queue manager and flush daemons need a wakeup timer.
#
# Max procs: the maximum number of processes that may execute this
# service simultaneously. Default is to use a globally configurable
# limit (the default_process_limit configuration parameter in main.cf).
# Specify 0 for no process count limit.
#
# Command + args: the command to be executed. The command name is
# relative to the Postfix program directory (pathname is controlled by
# the daemon_directory configuration variable). Adding one or more
# -v options turns on verbose logging for that service; adding a -D
# option enables symbolic debugging (see the debugger_command variable
# in the main.cf configuration file). See individual command man pages
# for specific command-line options, if any.
#
# General main.cf options can be overridden for specific services.
# To override one or more main.cf options, specify them as arguments
# below, preceding each option by "-o".  There must be no whitespace
# in the option itself (separate multiple values for an option by
# commas).
#
# In order to use the "uucp" message tranport below, set up entries
# in the transport table.
#
# In order to use the "cyrus" message transport below, configure it
# in main.cf as the mailbox_transport.
#
# SPECIFY ONLY PROGRAMS THAT ARE WRITTEN TO RUN AS POSTFIX DAEMONS.
# ALL DAEMONS SPECIFIED HERE MUST SPEAK A POSTFIX-INTERNAL PROTOCOL.
#
# DO NOT SHARE THE POSTFIX QUEUE BETWEEN MULTIPLE POSTFIX INSTANCES.
