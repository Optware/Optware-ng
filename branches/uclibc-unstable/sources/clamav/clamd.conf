#Example

# Uncomment this option to enable logging.
# LogFile must be writable for the user running daemon.
# A full path is required.
# Default: disabled
LogFile /opt/var/log/clamd.log

# By default the log file is locked for writing - the lock protects against
# running clamd multiple times (if want to run another clamd, please
# copy the configuration file, change the LogFile variable, and run
# the daemon with --config-file option).
# This option disables log file locking.
# Default: no
#LogFileUnlock yes

# Maximum size of the log file.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# You may use 'M' or 'm' for megabytes (1M = 1m = 1048576 bytes)
# and 'K' or 'k' for kilobytes (1K = 1k = 1024 bytes). To specify the size
# in bytes just don't use modifiers.
# Default: 1M
#LogFileMaxSize 2M

# Log time with each message.
# Default: no
LogTime yes

# Also log clean files. Useful in debugging but drastically increases the
# log size.

# Default: disabled (must be specified by a user)
LocalSocket /opt/tmp/clamd

# Remove stale socket after unclean shutdown.
# Default: no

## Executable files
##

# PE stands for Portable Executable - it's an executable file format used

# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# Default: 10M
#ArchiveMaxFileSize 15M
