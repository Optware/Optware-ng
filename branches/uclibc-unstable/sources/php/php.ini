[PHP]

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; About this file ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;
; This is the recommended, PHP 4-style version of the php.ini-dist file.  It
; sets some non standard settings, that make PHP more efficient, more secure,
; and encourage cleaner coding.
; The price is that with these settings, PHP may be incompatible with some
; applications, and sometimes, more difficult to develop with.  Using this
; file is warmly recommended for production sites.  As all of the changes from
; the standard settings are thoroughly documented, you can go over each one,
; and decide whether you want to use it or not.
;
; For general information about the php.ini file, please consult the php.ini-dist
; file, included in your PHP distribution.
;
; This file is different from the php.ini-dist file in the fact that it features
; different values for several directives, in order to improve performance, while
; possibly breaking compatibility with the standard out-of-the-box behavior of
; PHP 3.  Please make sure you read what's different, and modify your scripts
; accordingly, if you decide to use this file instead.
;
; - register_globals = Off         [Security, Performance]
;     Global variables are no longer registered for input data (POST, GET, cookies,
;     environment and other server variables).  Instead of using $foo, you must use
;     you can use $_REQUEST["foo"] (includes any variable that arrives through the
;     request, namely, POST, GET and cookie variables), or use one of the specific
;     $_GET["foo"], $_POST["foo"], $_COOKIE["foo"] or $_FILES["foo"], depending
;     on where the input originates.  Also, you can look at the
;     import_request_variables() function.
;     Note that register_globals is going to be depracated (i.e., turned off by
;     default) in the next version of PHP, because it often leads to security bugs.
;     Read http://php.net/manual/en/security.registerglobals.php for further
;     information.
; - display_errors = Off           [Security]
;     With this directive set to off, errors that occur during the execution of
;     scripts will no longer be displayed as a part of the script output, and thus,
;     will no longer be exposed to remote users.  With some errors, the error message
;     content may expose information about your script, web server, or database
;     server that may be exploitable for hacking.  Production sites should have this
;     directive set to off.
; - log_errors = On                [Security]
;     This directive complements the above one.  Any errors that occur during the
;     execution of your script will be logged (typically, to your server's error log,
;     but can be configured in several ways).  Along with setting display_errors to off,
;     this setup gives you the ability to fully understand what may have gone wrong,
;     without exposing any sensitive information to remote users.
; - output_buffering = 4096        [Performance]
;     Set a 4KB output buffer.  Enabling output buffering typically results in less
;     writes, and sometimes less packets sent on the wire, which can often lead to
;     better performance.  The gain this directive actually yields greatly depends
;     on which Web server you're working with, and what kind of scripts you're using.
; - register_argc_argv = Off       [Performance]
;     Disables registration of the somewhat redundant $argv and $argc global
;     variables.
; - magic_quotes_gpc = Off         [Performance]
;     Input data is no longer escaped with slashes so that it can be sent into
;     SQL databases without further manipulation.  Instead, you should use the
;     function addslashes() on each input element you wish to send to a database.
; - variables_order = "GPCS"       [Performance]
;     The environment variables are not hashed into the $HTTP_ENV_VARS[].  To access
;     environment variables, you can use getenv() instead.
; - error_reporting = E_ALL        [Code Cleanliness, Security(?)]
;     By default, PHP surpresses errors of type E_NOTICE.  These error messages
;     are emitted for non-critical errors, but that could be a symptom of a bigger
;     problem.  Most notably, this will cause error messages about the use
;     of uninitialized variables to be displayed.
; - allow_call_time_pass_reference = Off     [Code cleanliness]
;     It's not possible to decide to force a variable to be passed by reference
;     when calling a function.  The PHP 4 style to do this is by making the
;     function require the relevant argument by reference.

; Output buffering allows you to send header lines (including cookies) even
; after you send body content, at the price of slowing PHP's output layer a
; bit.  You can enable output buffering during runtime by calling the output
; buffering functions.  You can also enable output buffering for all files by
; setting this directive to On.  If you wish to limit the size of the buffer
; to a certain size - you can use a maximum number of bytes instead of 'On', as
; a value for this directive (e.g., output_buffering=4096).
output_buffering = Off

; You can redirect all of the output of your scripts to a function.  For
; example, if you set output_handler to "mb_output_handler", character
; encoding will be transparently converted to the specified encoding.
; Setting any output handler automatically turns on output buffering.
; Note: People who wrote portable scripts should not depend on this ini
;       directive. Instead, explicitly set the output handler using ob_start().
;       Using this ini directive may cause problems unless you know what script 
;       is doing.

; Note: Resulting chunk size may vary due to nature of compression. PHP 
;       outputs chunks that are few handreds bytes each as a result of compression. 
;       If you want larger chunk size for better performence, enable output_buffering 
;       also. 
; Note: output_handler must be empty if this is set 'On' !!!!

; implications and is generally recommended for debugging purposes only.
