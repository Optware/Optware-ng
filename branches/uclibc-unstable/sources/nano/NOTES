Modifications:
- configure.ac: duplicate AC_TRY_RUN, last line as separate argument for REGEX.

- autoconf

- configure

Problems:
- configure does not find ncurses, even if explicitly set
- make seems to want aclocal 1.7 and automake 1.7. We have 1.6 installed. We should
  disable the re-running of aclocal and automake etc...
