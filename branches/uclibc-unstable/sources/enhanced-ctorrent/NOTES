Enhanced CTorrent is built from the patched sources from Dennis Holmes
(dholmes@ct.boxmail.com), available at http://www.rahul.net/dholmes/ctorrent.

These are the additional patches that are applied to the current version
(dnh2.2), for bugs discovered in the NSLU2 port:

peer.patch: fix for segmentation fault inside CancelPiece(), due to
  the use of a pointer inside a struct that has just been freed


Enhanced CTorrent has only been tested on the NSLU2, although it builds 
correctly on some other platforms. Testers are welcomed.

Please check the Enhanced CTorrent page in the nslu2-linux project wiki,
at http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/Unslung/EnhancedCTorrent.
