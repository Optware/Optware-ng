   Overview

   [8]CTorrent is a [9]BitTorrent client implemented in C++ to be
   lightweight and quick. The original has fallen a little behind in
   updates and bug fixes though.

   The files here contain the good work of those who wrote the original
   CTorrent base code and a number of patches that provide fixes and
   enhancements, as well as additional fixes and enhancements that I am
   contributing. I am not the original author, current maintainer, or any
   other official representative of CTorrent. The files on this page are
   not the original or official CTorrent distribution. I encourage you to
   visit the [10]CTorrent project page on SourceForge for further
   information.

  Features

   The purpose of the Enhanced CTorrent effort is to fix problems that
   remain in the code, modernize existing features and algorithms, and
   implement new features while maintaining low overhead requirements and
   a high standard of performance (both part of the original CTorrent
   design philosophy). Highlights of the enhanced client include:
     * Support for large files (>2GB) and large torrents (>255 files)
     * Strategic selection of pieces to request for download
     * Continuous queueing of download requests, tuned based on latency
       and throughput for each peer
     * Improved download performance, including parallel requests in
       initial and endgame modes
     * Improved bandwidth regulation
     * Improved compatibility with other peers
     * Performance optimization and bug fixes
     * An interface for monitoring and managing multiple clients

  Documentation

   For documentation that provides a little more than the help screen,
   please see the [11]User's Guide.

   For a list of changes in the current and previous versions, see the
   [12]ChangeLog file.

  Peer ID

   Beginning with dnh1.1 the default peer ID has been changed for
   convenience, as some other clients and trackers assume that Ctorrent
   is "buggy" and won't cooperate with it. [Guess what, there are plenty
   of others with bugs too.] The -P option is still available if you wish
   to use a different peer ID, but it is no longer necessary to do so in
   order to avoid this "ban".

   The new default peer ID prefix is "-CDversion-", where version is an
   indication of the version number (0101 for dnh1.1).

  CTCS

   [13]CTorrent Control Server (CTCS) is an interface for monitoring and
   managing Enhanced CTorrent clients. It can manage allocation of
   bandwidth, provide status information, and allow changes to the
   running configuration of each client. Support for this interface was
   added in the dnh2 release.
