#	normal.conf -- Default Configuration for the Mbedthis AppWeb HTTP Server
#	
#	This configuration file controls the operation of the AppWeb 
#	server. The order of configuration directives matters as this 
#	file is parsed only once. You must put the server root and error 
#	log definitions first to ensure configuration errors are logged.
#

#
#	Root directory for AppWeb to find necessary files and DLLs. 
#	AppWeb will change directory to this location when it runs.

#
#	Log all AppWeb errors and trace to this file. This is the error 
#	file for the whole server including all virtual hosts.

#	ServerName http://localhost:7777

#
#	Location for documents for the primary server host. Virtual hosts 
#	may define their own DocumentRoot directives.
#
DocumentRoot web

#
#	Bind AppWeb to listen for incoming requests on this address. 
#	Formats include (IP, IP:PORT, PORT). If an IP address is omitted, 
#	AppWeb will listen on all interfaces. If a port is omitted, then 
#	port 80 is used.
#
Listen 81

#	Map handlers to file extensions. If the extension is ommitted, the 
#	handler itself will determine if a match to a given URL occurs. For
#	example: authHandler is always run on all URLs. Handler matching
#	to extensions occurs after the URL is descaped but before aliases
#	are applied.

AddHandler authHandler

#
#	For Scripts, such as your Perl scripts make sure that you have

#	The .bat and .cmd extensions are really only for Windows.

#	These actions specify the program to run for each Perl or Python 
#	script. They map to the extensions specified in the mime.types for for 
#	these mime types. Alternatively, you may use put all your scripts in 
#	the subdirectories specified by the releavant Location blocks below.
#	For perl and python, you can also put "#!/path/to/program" as the first 
#	line. This works on Windows as well. The .bat and .cmd extensions are
