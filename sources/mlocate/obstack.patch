+
+/* Summary:
+
+   All the apparent functions defined here are macros. The idea
+   is that you would use these pre-tested macros to solve a
+   very specific set of problems, and they would run fast.
+   Caution: no side-effects in arguments please!! They may be
+   evaluated MANY times!!
+
+   These macros operate a stack of objects.  Each object starts life
+   small, and may grow to maturity.  (Consider building a word syllable
+   by syllable.)  An object can move while it is growing.  Once it has
+   been "finished" it never changes address again.  So the "top of the
+   stack" is typically an immature growing object, while the rest of the
+   stack is of mature, fixed size and fixed address objects.
+
+   These routines grab large chunks of memory, using a function you
+   supply, called 'obstack_chunk_alloc'.  On occasion, they free chunks,
+   by calling 'obstack_chunk_free'.  You must define them and declare
+   them before using any obstack macros.
+
+   Each independent stack is represented by a 'struct obstack'.
+   Each of the obstack macros expects a pointer to such a structure
+   as the first argument.
+
+   One motivation for this package is the problem of growing char strings
+   in symbol tables.  Unless you are "fascist pig with a read-only mind"
+   --Gosper's immortal quote from HAKMEM item 154, out of context--you
+   would not like to put any arbitrary upper limit on the length of your
+   symbols.
+
+   In practice this often means you will build many short symbols and a
+   few long symbols.  At the time you are reading a symbol you don't know
+   how long it is.  One traditional method is to read a symbol into a
+   buffer, realloc()ating the buffer every time you try to read a symbol
+   that is longer than the buffer.  This is beaut, but you still will
+   want to copy the symbol from the buffer to a more permanent
+   symbol-table entry say about half the time.
+
+   With obstacks, you can work differently.  Use one obstack for all symbol
+   names.  As you read a symbol, grow the name in the obstack gradually.
+   When the name is complete, finalize it.  Then, if the symbol exists already,
+   free the newly read name.
+
+   The way we do this is to take a large chunk, allocating memory from
+   low addresses.  When you want to build a symbol in the chunk you just
+   add chars above the current "high water mark" in the chunk.  When you
+   have finished adding chars, because you got to the end of the symbol,
+   you know how long the chars are, and you can create a new object.
+   Mostly the chars will not burst over the highest address of the chunk,
+   because you would typically expect a chunk to be (say) 100 times as
+   long as an average object.
+
+   In case that isn't clear, when we have enough chars to make up
+   the object, THEY ARE ALREADY CONTIGUOUS IN THE CHUNK (guaranteed)
+   so we just point to it where it lies.  No moving of chars is
+   needed and this is the second win: potentially long strings need
+   never be explicitly shuffled. Once an object is formed, it does not
+   change its address during its lifetime.
+
+   When the chars burst over a chunk boundary, we allocate a larger
+   chunk, and then copy the partly formed object from the end of the old
+   chunk to the beginning of the new larger chunk.  We then carry on
+   accreting characters to the end of the object as we normally would.
+
+   A special macro is provided to add a single char at a time to a
+   growing object.  This allows the use of register variables, which
+   break the ordinary 'growth' macro.
+
+   Summary:
+        We allocate large chunks.
+        We carve out one object at a time from the current chunk.
+        Once carved, an object never moves.
+        We are free to append data of any size to the currently
+          growing object.
+        Exactly one object is growing in an obstack at any one time.
+        You can run one obstack per control block.
+        You may have as many control blocks as you dare.
+        Because of the way we do it, you can "unwind" an obstack
+          back to a previous state. (You may remove objects much
+          as you would with a stack.)
