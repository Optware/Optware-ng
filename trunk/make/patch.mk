# You must replace "patch" and "PATCH" with the lower case name and
# upper case name of your new package.  Some places below will say
# "Do not change this" - that does not include this global change,
# which must always be done to ensure we have unique names.

#
# PATCH_VERSION, PATCH_SITE and PATCH_SOURCE define
# the upstream location of the source code for the package.
# PATCH_DIR is the directory which is created when the source
# archive is unpacked.
# PATCH_UNZIP is the command used to unzip the source.
# It is usually "zcat" (for .gz) or "bzcat" (for .bz2)
#
# You should change all these variables to suit your package.
