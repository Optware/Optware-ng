# ENDIAN_VERSION, ENDIAN_SITE and ENDIAN_SOURCE define
# the upstream location of the source code for the package.
# ENDIAN_DIR is the directory which is created when the source
# archive is unpacked.
# ENDIAN_UNZIP is the command used to unzip the source.
# It is usually "zcat" (for .gz) or "bzcat" (for .bz2)
#
# You should change all these variables to suit your package.
# Please make sure that you add a description, and that you
# list all your packages' dependencies, seperated by commas.

# address, and indicate your irc nick if it cannot be easily deduced
# from your name or email address.  If you leave MAINTAINER set to
