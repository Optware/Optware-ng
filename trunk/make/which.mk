# You must replace "which" and "WHICH" with the lower case name and

# WHICH_VERSION, WHICH_SITE and WHICH_SOURCE define
# the upstream location of the source code for the package.
# WHICH_DIR is the directory which is created when the source
# archive is unpacked.
# WHICH_UNZIP is the command used to unzip the source.
# It is usually "zcat" (for .gz) or "bzcat" (for .bz2)
#
# You should change all these variables to suit your package.

WHICH_DESCRIPTION=which prints out the full path of the executablesthat bash(1) would execute when the passed program names would have been entered on the shell prompt. It uses the exact same algorithm as bash. Tildes and a dot in the PATH are now expanded to the full path by default. Options allow users to print "~/*" or "./*" and/or to  print all executables that match any directory in the PATH
