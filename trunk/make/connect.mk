# CONNECT_VERSION, CONNECT_SITE and CONNECT_SOURCE define

# CONNECT_DIR is the directory which is created when the source
# archive is unpacked.
# CONNECT_UNZIP is the command used to unzip the source.
# It is usually "zcat" (for .gz) or "bzcat" (for .bz2)
#
# You should change all these variables to suit your package.
