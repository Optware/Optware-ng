# PY-ELEMENTTREE_VERSION, PY-ELEMENTTREE_SITE and PY-ELEMENTTREE_SOURCE define
# the upstream location of the source code for the package.
# PY-ELEMENTTREE_DIR is the directory which is created when the source
# archive is unpacked.
# PY-ELEMENTTREE_UNZIP is the command used to unzip the source.
# It is usually "zcat" (for .gz) or "bzcat" (for .bz2)
#
# You should change all these variables to suit your package.
