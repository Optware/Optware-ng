# IPERF_VERSION, IPERF_SITE and IPERF_SOURCE define

# IPERF_DIR is the directory which is created when the source
# archive is unpacked.
# IPERF_UNZIP is the command used to unzip the source.
# It is usually "zcat" (for .gz) or "bzcat" (for .bz2)
#
# You should change all these variables to suit your package.

# address, and indicate your irc nick if it cannot be easily deduced
# from your name or email address.  If you leave MAINTAINER set to
