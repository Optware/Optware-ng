# HTTPING_VERSION, HTTPING_SITE and HTTPING_SOURCE define
# the upstream location of the source code for the package.
# HTTPING_DIR is the directory which is created when the source
# archive is unpacked.
# HTTPING_UNZIP is the command used to unzip the source.
# It is usually "zcat" (for .gz) or "bzcat" (for .bz2)
#
# You should change all these variables to suit your package.
# Please make sure that you add a description, and that you
# list all your packages' dependencies, seperated by commas.
# 
# If you list yourself as MAINTAINER, please give a valid email
# address, and indicate your irc nick if it cannot be easily deduced
# from your name or email address.  If you leave MAINTAINER set to
# "NSLU2 Linux" other developers will feel free to edit.

HTTPING_DESCRIPTION=httping is a "ping"-like tool for HTTP requests. Give it a URL and it will show how long it takes to connect, send a request, and retrieve the reply (only the headers). It can be used for monitoring or statistical purposes (measuring latency).
