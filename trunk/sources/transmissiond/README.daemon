README.daemon

CGI interface to daemon is for managing and preview of the daemon state.
There is also torrent_watchdog script for automatic torrent
queue processing and mail notification.

Features

* batch multiprocessing (eg. 10 torrents simultaneously with nice priority)
* automatic seeding when torrent finishes (configurable)
* configurable ports
* WWW interface transmission.cgi can be public (no password) as
   there is no delete provided.
* Accelerator keys (ALT-Shift-key) for CGI interface. See help for underlined keys.
* Per torrent and cumulative status
* start/stop/push/bypass and other commands available in WWW interface
* lightweight - low memory footprint
* tracker scrape info. Suggest best seed torrent from target dir.
* watchdog for auto restart/queue processing with cron
* syslog watchdog events
* mail notify when torrent finishes
* no state database required. Directory tree is database (slow, but fail-safe)
* stable and portable. Developed on Asus WL-500g Deluxe with OpenWrt Kamikaze firmware 

Workflow

For queue torrent file processing there should exist tree directories:
source - User should copy .torrent files here
work   - Used for torrent processing
target - Place where finished torrents are put

Typical file flow is source -> work -> target For every torrent file from
source, directory with the same name is created. Then torrent file is moved
into this directory and transmissiond is run in background and constantly
supervised with transmission_watchdog. The only way for moving finished 
active torrent into target dir is with Watchdog and not with Push. 

CGI interface to daemon after each command lists all torrents in database.
This time consuming can be interrupted at any time by giving next command
or pressing stop button in WWW browser. This can be done for all commands
except URL, Note and Rename as the action on torrent is taken during
listing. This means that listing should not be interrupted until torrent is
listed. In general there is no problem of interrupting listing at any
point. This will not invalidate database which is file system alone.

Fetch command is useful only for fetching torrent files without passkey as
there is no possibility to pass cookies to server. Use with care. Proper 
fetch would be "download in browser and then upload to server". 
This can only be done by browser plugin.

Troubles with tracker communication can be seen in syslog file.
transmission_watchdog moves torrent to Suspended queue if Error: is
reported by tracker.

Before running transmission user should carefully inspect variables in
transmission.conf and create SOURCE, WORK, and TARGET directories

transmission_watchdog cares for queue processing and should be run every
30 minutes with cron. /opt/etc/crontab entry should look like:

# m  h dom mon dow user command
*/30 *    * * *   admin nice transmission_watchdog 

For graphing to work properly, gnuplot and syslog is required. As log can
accumulate it is recommended that logrotate is used for flushing old logs.
/opt/etc/logrotate.conf recommended config is:
compress

/opt/var/log/messages {
        size 1024k
        weekly
        rotate 9
        postrotate
                killall -HUP syslogd
        endscript
}

include /opt/etc/logrotate.d

For syslog on Asus - Oleg firmware it is recommended that
/opt/etc/init.d/S05syslogd is created with the following content:

#!/bin/sh
#
# Startup script for syslogd
#
# Stop myself if running
if [ -n "`pidof syslogd`" ]; then
    /usr/bin/killall syslogd 2>/dev/null
fi
# remove old syslog.log
rm /tmp/syslog.log
# add symlink so log is available at old location (e.g. for webinterface)
ln -s /opt/var/log/messages /tmp/syslog.log
/sbin/syslogd -m 0 -O /opt/var/log/messages -S -l 7

To disable rate control set upload/download limit to -1 in transmission.conf
Ratecontrol counts only good transferred packets. Handshaking and other
non-data transfer does not count. This means that there are some packets
in transfer that are not affected by ratecontrol ant that UPLOAD_SPEED should
be set to lower value than max upload line capability.

HOME variable is used for daemon to find its .transmission directory where
cache data for each torrent is stored for fast resume. Proper restore
requires that system time is functioning as file mtime is checked. Assure
that time sync is retrieved with ntp or RTC.

Troubleshooting daemon & CGI interface

Very helpful command for debugging shell script is "sh -x
/opt/share/www/cgi-bin/transmission.cgi" This will print out every line and
its content.

I suggest to install procps package and then use
/opt/bin/ps axf to see output like this:

9179 ? SNs 0:01 transmissiond -p 65534 -w 600 -u -1 -d -1 -i ..
9180 ? SN  0:00  \_ transmissiond -p 65534 -w 600 -u -1 -d -1 -i  ...
9181 ? SN  0:00      \_ transmissiond -p 65534 -w 600 -u -1 -d -1 -i ..



Master thread in above example has PID=9179 Sending "kill -USR1 9197" must
write .status files. This should also be done by CGI.

There is also -USR2 signal which writes active torrents into syslog. But
syslog must be running also for getting cumulative statistics!

.status file is sourced. Filenames should not contain non ASCII characters
and quote. Spaces and characters like [](). are allowed in torrent filenames.
Note that NO spaces is allowed for directories ${SOURCE}, ${WORK} and ${TARGET}.

When one presses "Update" button signal -USR1 is sent to daemon and after a
second of waiting for it, all active .status files are sourced and printed.

Problems with .status could be that transmisisond is not receiving USR1 signal.
This may be due to invalid path to PIDFILE or something like that. 
Pressing Update sends signal to daemon, waits one second and reads 
.status files in active torrent directories. Take attention to syslog daemon.

"torrent" package conflict is intentional.
If you want transfer graph log then gnuplot must be installed.

For using www browser on router itself package lynx or elink is recommended.
lynx http://localhost:8008/cgi-bin/transmission.cgi

Known bugs:
* There is a problem with fork and pthreads in uclibc 0.9.19
  See http://www.busybox.net/lists/uclibc/2003-March/005825.html
  This affect only users of Oleg firmware on Asus routers with
  http://ipkg.nslu2-linux.org/feeds/optware/wl500g/cross/stable/
  package feed. Users are instructed to switch to
  http://ipkg.nslu2-linux.org/feeds/optware/oleg/cross/stable/
  which uses newer uClibc 0.9.28 and NLPT or change transmission_watchdog
  daemon startup code to 

  nohup transmissiond -v 1 -p ${LISTENING_PORT} \
        -w ${WATCHDOG} \
        -u ${UPLOAD_SPEED} \
        -d ${DOWNLOAD_SPEED} \
        -i ${PIDFILE}   ${ACTIVE} 2> /dev/null &

  which will spawn daemon in foreground mode and trash error messages.

  See http://wl500g.info/showpost.php?p=34579&postcount=68 how to upgrade
  to alternative "Oleg"  package feed.

* With upgrade to r2220 and later one must take care, that there will
not be unfinished torrents otherwise Transmission will report "hash FAILED".
Erase such torrents and start over. Same instruction goes to problem with 
high loads (over 20) causing system freeze. In such cases is recommended
to erase cache files with rm -rf ${WORK}/.transmission


OpenWRT and Xwrt(OpenWRT for mere mortals) notes:

   With whiterussian OpenWRT and Xwrt is fully operational. 
   I recommend to create disk partitions (opt, swap and data) with
   some linux system as the OpenWRT lacks some fdisk and
   busybox (mkswap, swapon, swapof) packages which can be found on
   rc5-backports.
   
   Install the following USB and ext2/3 packages:
    - kmod-usb-core - 2.4.30-brcm-5 - Kernel Support for USB
    - kmod-usb-storage - 2.4.30-brcm-5 - Kernel modules for USB storage support
    - kmod-usb2 - 2.4.30-brcm-5 - Kernel driver for USB2 controllers
    - kmod-ext2 - 2.4.30-brcm-5 - Kernel modules for EXT2 filesystem support
    - kmod-ext3 - 2.4.30-brcm-5 - Kernel modules for EXT3 filesystem support

But after that you will be able to mount disk partitions.
See http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/FAQ/Optware-uClibcBuild
for aditional X-wrt notes.

Follow dd-wrt guidelines for installing Optware packages to X-wrt
http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Optware

   logrotate is not necessary as the OpenWRT cron and log daemon (circular Local LOG)
   can be used. Recommended size for /var/log/messages is 100kB. If using
   circular buffer then logread should be used to read its data.
   If using logread then transmission.cgi must be updated at some lines
   where ${SYSLOG} occurs:

   SPEED=`logread | tail  | sed  -n '/transmissiond/s/.*\dl \([0-9.]\{1,\}\) ul \([0-9.]\{1,\}\).*/DOWNLOAD="\1";UPLOAD="\2"/p' | tail -1`

#if [ ! -r ${SYSLOG} ]; then
#  echo "<p>${SYSLOG} not readable. Properly configure syslogd at "
#  echo "system startup.</p>"
#  return                                                                                                                                           
#fi
echo "<pre>"
logread |sed  -n -e "/transmissiond/{s/.*: \([0-9]\{1,10\}\) [0-9]\{1,\} dl \([0-9.]\{1,\}\) ul \([0-9.]\{1,\}\) ld \([0-9.]\{1,\}\)/\1 \2 -\3 \4/;t
echo "</pre>"


   
   /opt/etc/transmission.conf changes:
   SYSLOG=/var/log/messages

   Using OpenWRT cron daemon for watchdog purposes
   Create the following /etc/crontab contents:
   SHELL=/bin/sh
   PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/opt/bin:/opt/sbin
   MAILTO=""
   HOME=/
   # ---------- ---------- Default is Empty ---------- ---------- #
   # m h dom mon dow user  command
   30 *    * * *   root nice transmission_watchdog

   then run "crontab /etc/crontab"
   and edit with crontab -e root
  
FAQ

1. Why wont the daemon start downloading after rebooting ? I need to push
it to suspend and then again to make it work ? It will restart after reboot
if you properly configured cron to run transmisison_watchdog periodicly.
For manual restart use Watchdog button.

2. How do i make it download 5 torrents at the same time ? Can this be done
? Sure it can. Use Push button. You can also queue torrents, manual
administer and get some transfer graph.

3. Is it possible to output a chart with no_UTC time (X-axis) ? 
Just set TIMEZONE_OFFSET=seconds in transmission.conf 

4. I just installed transmission package, pushed some torrent and it looks
working. But when I press Update button, I get this result: ".status not
found for <torrent_path>" Problems with .status could be that transmisisond
is not receiving USR1 signal. This may be due to invalid path to PIDFILE or
something like that. Pressing Update sends signal to daemon, waits one
second and reads .status files in active torrent directories. Take
attention to syslog daemon.

5. Do I need "torrent" ipkg installed too?
No. torrent package conflict is intentional.

6. I am getting some errors

cat: /opt/var/run/transmission.pid: No such file or directory
/opt/share/www/cgi-bin/transmission.cgi: kill: 624: Usage: kill [-s sigspec
| -signum | -sigspec] [pid | job]... or kill -l [exitstatus]getting some
errors cat: /opt/var/run/transmission.pid: No such file or directory
/opt/share/www/cgi-bin/transmission.cgi: kill: 624: Usage: kill [-s sigspec
| -signum | -sigspec] [pid | job]... or kill -l [exitstatus]

  This means that Transmisison daemon is not running. Use Watchdog button
 to start in manually.

7. Tried manually pressing watchdog for nothing. Im still having that text
 under the buttons on the script page :

 /opt/share/www/cgi-bin/transmission.cgi: kill: 624: (249) - No such process .

 It looks like daemon died for some reason. Take a look into syslog
 messages. The recommended way for running is using "Oleg" feed and not
 default "wl500g".

8. What directories need to be created by default?
mkdir /tmp/harddisk/torrent
mkdir /tmp/harddisk/torrent/source
mkdir /tmp/harddisk/torrent/work
mkdir /tmp/harddisk/torrent/target
chmod a+rw /tmp/harddisk/torrent
chmod a+rw /tmp/harddisk/torrent/source
chmod a+rw /tmp/harddisk/torrent/target
chmod a+rw /tmp/harddisk/torrent/work

9. My daemon dies frequently. 512 MB swap is recommended on 32MB routers.


10. How do I password protect transmission.cgi script? Use appropriate web
 server and its protection. busybox_http uses IP access and password
 protection with httpd.conf

11. Can I set some cap on UPLOAD_SPEED or is this thing totally bugged ? If
 bugged any workaround ? This bug is a hard thing. Anyway ratecontrol is
 somehow useless as it limits only good packets and not the whole
 transport. I recommend to use some QOS router capabilities. Personally I
 use another OpenWRT router.

12. Does this daemon allow active port transfer? I mean do i have to open
 ports manually thru iptables to point the active port to router or
 similar? I believe program who use active connections boosts the transfers
 in seeding or receiving, allowing more connetions.

 You need to open incoming TCP port on router (65534). It also recommended
 to allow ping responses (ICMP protocol). To check connectivity with
 telneting to your listening port
 
 telnet  your.outside.router.ip 65534
 Connected to your.outside.router.ip
 Escape character is '^]'.
 help me
 Nice try...
 Connection closed by foreign host.

 You should get "Nice try..." response.

13. How can I interpret load average and uptime values in graph and CGI? We
   can assume (by looking at procps top) that CPU is mostly idling and that
   most uninterruptable state is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting
   for disk access. So load average over 1 means that external USB disk is
   doing operations for more processes and it cannot handle without waiting
   for disk. In such cases I recommend to lower the number of active
   torrents. Mostly downloading gives much burden.

14. Is there an easy way to open ports for transmission? Yes. If your
    router soupports traversal using NAT-PMP or UPnP IGD services just
    uncomment NAT_TRAVERSAL line in /opt/etc/transmission.conf

15. I'm trying to get the graph to work for transmission the cron is
   running and everything is logging to syslog but the only thing that is
   showing up is load. Edit : I got it working but is there a way to have
   it form a line like load does.

   I do not recommend anything else than spikes for Transmission graphing.
   SysLog rotation should be tailored in such way that it acumulates approx
   one week. Then spikes will show in high density and you will see if
   there was any interruption without hearbeat. Lines like load could be
   changed in transmission.cgi but then you will loose interval display.
   Maybe linespoints is middleway?

16. I am getting "Could not open ....nfo in /tmp/harddisk/torrent/work/...
  (0, -2147483640)" This bug is harmless. It tries to check nonexistent
  file at startup. libtransmission developer should eventually add empty
  file creation or skip this check.

17. I also implemented transmission and I am very much excited. But shame
   on me, I am not able to purge these damned completed torrents. I tried
   everything.

   This is the feature of the Transmission. You cannot remove torrents with
   WWW interface!
   Use simple file removal like:
	cd /tmp/harddisk/torrent/target 
	ls -lt */*.torrent
	rm -rf My.Torrent.directory

   Or just use simple samba share and delete it under Windows explorer. For
   active and suspended torrents use: Push them with the 'push' button from
   Seeding state to Suspend. Then select the torrent en click Remove. After
   that you can Purge them into oblivion.

   There is also an option add FORCE_REMOVE="YES" to transmission.conf and
   this will enable removing of DONE non-seeding torrents. Use with caution
   when exposing CGI page to internet.

18. My links: "source" "work" and "target" are not valid. This depends on
 your http daemon. If you are using busybox_httpd then there is no autodir
 feature and links are preaty useless. If thttpd is used the you can create
 symlinks to directories and enable follow symlinks in config. Same goes to
 other servers. Anyway this links are not regarded as a feature but rather
 useless convenience.

19. Well, it does not work at all When i choose push on a torrent i just
get the infamous "/opt/share/www/cgi-bin/transmission.cgi: kill: 9: (335) -
No such process" error .. It is assumed that transmssiond is started
through transmission_watchdog when you are using transmission.cgi. If
transmissiond is stopped/paused/not running then you get informational
message like (kill, not running, ...) This is not a problem if you know
what you are doing. You can administer torrents even faster if
transmissiond is not running. When finished with huge rearangements the you
can unpause and restart with watchdog.

transmission_watchdog is run every 30 minutes or so through cron process.
That's why there is no startup script for transmissiond. Although I've seen
that some people run transmission_watchdog at system startup, I do not
recommend such practice.

20. I am getting .status not found. I am getting Unable to find recent
transfer stats in syslog.

transmissiond wirks in nonblocking mode. This means that some stats in
.status file are written when transmissiond gets time to write them.
Sometimes transmissiond is too busy to write status on time and it misses
status wtiteout that CGI fetches. This is harmless but confusing sometimes
as it shows different sum of transfer stats. Just press Update again and
stats should be updated correctly.

21. How can I install the new version ?  Cos by doing ipkg update it will 
erase my configuration.
Transmisison will not erase your configuration during upgrade!
It will always ask you what to do with /opt/etc/transmission.conf
Use ipkg update and ipkg upgrade for package upgrade!

22. The interface PAUSE button is missinterpreted. If I click on the PAUSE button, I have to click again on the same button to resume the transfers. Took me about 1 hour to find out this.
Think of Pause button as Pause on tape recorder. It Stops/Starts activity of the transmission daemon. And yes, it is design problem of the static header that prevents Resume/Pause button.

23. How to get the busybox httpd work with it ?
   Instead of busybox httpd  you could use thttpd.

24. How do I check if listening port is correctly opened? 
  Try http://www.utorrent.com:16000/testport2.php?port=65534

25. I am getting core dumps. 
If you are keen enough you can run debug version of transmission with
setting DBG=-dbg in transmission.conf

When crash occurs you will find a coredump in $HOME/.config/transmission 
directory. Then just run

gdb /opt/bin/transmissiond-dbg core.PID

and type

where

to unroll the stack.
If this is too deep you will need to

set heuristic-fence-post 30000

or so. Then if you do not understand the report to fix the bug for yourself, 
just post this stack in a similar or new ticket.

It is better to run gdb by attaching to the process and to mask signals that we 
do not want to follow. If it fail at startup it will show location like the following example:
export HOME=/home/torrent
gdb /opt/bin/transmissiond-dbg
handle SIG32 noprint
handle SIGHUP noprint
handle SIGUSR1 noprint
handle SIGUSR2 noprint
run -p 65534 -e -w 300 -u 35 -d 180 -i /opt/var/run/transmission.pid /home/torrent/active-torrents.txt
attach 25403

26. Is there any way to make log graph show more then two days?
There is no such limitation. The range depends on the contents of the syslog file. So if you have small size of the syslog, try to increase it that it will hold a week of so for logs.

27. I have been using transmission successfully according to the setup of wengi, everything works great with the newest firmware. However, when downloading a torrentof course this takes some (or sometimes considerably) bandwith, so then it is convenient to pause transmission. A shame when I find out the next day that I have forgotten to unpause it, so it has been standing still for the night. I think it should be possible for example, to let cron switch it on again, say at midnight. Has anyone any idea how to program this, what is the command that should be used? Or is there any other way to accomplish this?
Try something like the following line in your crontab.
# m h dom mon dow command
12  23 * * * /bin/rm  /tmp/harddisk/torrent/work/.paused

28. I (and several other users) have the problem that the transmission.cgi is hanging when listing the torrents. At this point it consumes 100% cpu.
This looks like busybox /bin/sh problem. Install bash and replace first line of transmission.cgi with #!/opt/bin/bash

29. Where is transmission.conf? CGI interface with its daemon is now shipped as separate pakage.
   You need to install package transmissiond to get it back.
