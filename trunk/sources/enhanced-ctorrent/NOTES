Enhanced CTorrent is built from the patched sources from Dennis Holmes
(dholmes@ct.boxmail.com), available at http://www.rahul.net/dholmes/ctorrent.

The current version is dnh3, with the clock_gettime patch.

Enhanced CTorrent has only been tested on the NSLU2, although it builds 
correctly on some other platforms. Testers are welcomed.

Please check the Enhanced CTorrent page in the nslu2-linux project wiki,
