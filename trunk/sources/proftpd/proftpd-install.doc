PROFTPD on NSLU2 readme
=======================

Manual install instructions:
----------------------------
1: Proftpd can run under xinetd or as standalone server. It is by default 
   setup to run under xinetd and installs its xinetd definition file under 
   /opt/etc/xinetd.d.

   Edit the proftpd cofiguration file /opt/etc/proftpd.conf to suit your 
   taste and run xinetd.reload to make xinetd enable the proftpd service.

2: To run standalone, edit /opt/etc/xinet.d setting "disable=yes". Then copy 
   /opt/doc/proftpd/S58proftpd to /opt/etc/init.d and edit proftpd.conf so that 
   "ServerType" is "standalone".


On creating certificates and keys:
----------------------------------
A simple way of generating a 1024bits RSA key pair valid for about 3 years is:

openssl req -new -x509 -days 1200 -nodes -out /opt/etc/ftpd/server.cert.pem -keyout /opt/etc/ftpd/server.key.pem

You must have installed OpenSSL for SSL/TLS authenication and encryption to work. 
NOTE: Remember to make the secret key unreadable for non-root users.

On root login:
--------------
Root login is disabled per default. This also goes for those users in /opt/etc/ftpusers
and those users without a valid shell. Edit the config file to allow such access.

On xinetd and internet access:
------------------------------
Per default the /opt/etc/xinetd.d/proftpd file only permits access from local
host and local network. 

On logging:
-----------
In the sample configuration file, proftpd.conf, WtmpLog has been disabled as 
the tinylogin wtmp has yet to be made reliable on the NSLU2.
