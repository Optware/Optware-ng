PROFTPD on NSLU2 readme
=======================

Manual install instructions:
----------------------------
1: Proftpd can run either as standalone server or under some inetd
 (a) To run as standalone server, copy /opt/doc/proftpd/S68proftpd to /opt/etc/init.d/S68proftpd . Also edit proftpd.conf so that "ServerType" is "standalone" (by default it is "inetd")
 (b) To run under Linksys inetd, copy /opt/doc/rc.xinetd.proftpd to /unslung/rc.xinetd if there is no pre-existing /unslung/rc.xinetd, else edit it manually into the existing file.
 (c) To run under inetutils inetd, execute "cat /opt/doc/proftpd/inetd.conf.proftpd >> /opt/etc/inetd.conf"
 (d) To run under xinetd, copy /opt/doc/proftpd/proftpd.xinetd to /opt/etc/xinetd.d/proftpd"
2: A default configuration is stored in /opt/etc/proftpd.conf - Please edit it to suit your needs and refer to the documentation and the tempates stored in /opt/doc/proftpd.
3: Any FTP server already active on the system must be disabled.
4: Starting proftd either by restarting your system or...
 (a) To run as standalone server, run ". /opt/etc/init.d/S68proftpd"
 (b) To run under Linksys/inetutils inetd or xinetd, run ". /etc/rc.d/rc.xinetd"

On creating certificates and keys:
----------------------------------
A simple way of generating a 1024bits RSA key pair valid for about 3 years is:

openssl req -new -x509 -days 1200 -nodes -out /opt/etc/ftpd/server.cert.pem -keyout /opt/etc/ftpd/server.key.pem

You must have installed OpenSSL for SSL/TLS authenication and encryption to work. 
NOTE: Remember to make the secret key unreadable for non-root users.

On root login:
--------------
Root login is disabled per default. This also goes for those users in /opt/etc/ftpusers
and those users without a valid shell. Edit the config file to allow such access.

On xinetd and internet access:
------------------------------
Per default the /opt/etc/xinetd.d/proftpd file only permits access from local
host and local network. 

On logging:
-----------
In the sample configuration file, proftpd.conf, WtmpLog has been disabled. Linksys 
syslogd does not provide this type of logging. In order to have this, it is 
recomended to install a proper syslogd, like the one from inetutils.
