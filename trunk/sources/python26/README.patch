+Cross Compiling
+---------------
+
+Python can be cross compiled by supplying different --host and --build
+parameters to configure.  (Python is compiled on the "build" system
+and executed on the "host" system, in case you forgot :).  Python is
+tricky to cross compile because it needs to execute parts of itself
+during construction.  To work around this, make's VPATH feature is
+used to compile a native python in the subdirectory "buildpython25".
+When parts of python need to be executed during construction, the
+"buildpython25" versions are used.
+
+A consequence of using the VPATH feature is that you may not do a
+cross compile build in the source directory.  In other words, do this:
+
+mkdir mydir
+cd mydir
+../Python/configure --host=powerpc-405-linux-gnu --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu
+make
+
+Cross compiling works well under linux, mileage may vary for other
+platforms.
+
+A few reminders on using configure to cross compile:
+- Cross compile tools must be in the PATH.
+- Cross compile tools must be prefixed with the host type
+(ie powerpc-405-linux-gnu-cc, powerpc-405-linux-gnu-ranlib, ...)
+- CC, CXX, AR, and RANLIB must be undefined when running configure and
+make.  Configure will detect them.
