Bug-Reference-ID: <20051210223218.GD3324@toucan.gentoo.org>
Bug-Reference-URL:http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2005-12/msg00021.html

options to `ulimit', the exact expansions for `case' patterns, clarification
of the language concerning the return value of `[[', and updated version
information.
