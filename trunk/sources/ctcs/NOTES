CTorrent Control Server (CTCS) is built from the sources by Daniel
Holmes, available at http://www.rahul.net/dholmes/ctorrent/ctcs.html,
plus a set of patches for the NSLU2.

The current list of patches for version 1.4 is:

  socket.patch: fix for side effects of SO_REUSEADDR.
  perl.patch: correct path for perl executable

CTCS has only been tested on the NSLU2, but since it is just a Perl
script, chances are it will work fine in other platforms.

Please check the CTCS package page in the nslu2-linux project wiki,
