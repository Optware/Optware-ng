* create a toolchain for the new platform <P>

* create a platforms/toolchain-<P>.mk
  GNU_TARGET_NAME will be used in almost all package configuration
  it usually should match the output of
    `make query-TARGET_CC` -dumpmachine

* [optional but recommended] automate toolchain creation

* create a platforms/packages-<P>.mk

* make <P>-target
  cd <P>
  make directories ipkg-utils
  make toolchain

* make hello-ipk

* add an entry to %target_to_bintype in scripts/optware-check-package.pl
  with `file binary` regex pattern, after than you can run
  make hello-check

* set NO_BUILTIN_MATH correctly in platforms/toolchain-<P>.mk
  set GETTEXT_NLS correctly in platforms/toolchain-<P>.mk

* provide LIBNSL_VERSION in make/libnsl.mk

* if libstdc++, fill-in libstdc++ version in make/libstdc++.mk
  if exclusively libuclibc++, work out the libstdc++ wrapper

* to test the build of a C++ program, you can try
  make re2c-check
  `make query-TARGET_CROSS`objdump -p builds/re2c-*-ipk/opt/bin/re2c | grep NEED

* it's a good idea to get perl working early by providing a config.sh
  under sources/perl/Cross/
    either a config.sh-<P>
    or config.sh-$(GNU_TARGET_NAME)
  the following packages conditionally depends on the presence of perl:
    grep -l ifeq.*filter.*perl make/*.mk
  so enable the feed after getting perl working, or rebuild these packages.
